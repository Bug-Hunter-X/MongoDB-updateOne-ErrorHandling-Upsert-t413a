# MongoDB updateOne - Error Handling and Upsert

This example demonstrates a common error when using MongoDB's `updateOne` method. The code doesn't properly handle the returned result, and could lead to subtle bugs, especially when using the `upsert` option.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file shows an implementation that omits important error handling and doesn't explicitly check for the successful update or insertion (when `upsert: true`).  This makes debugging difficult and might lead to data inconsistencies.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version, demonstrating best practices for robust error handling and clear communication of the upsert result.
